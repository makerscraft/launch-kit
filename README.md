## Set up

1. Start by reading [our graphical guidelines](https://github.com/lewagon/design/tree/master/guidelines) and downloading all our [brand assets](https://github.com/lewagon/design/tree/master/guidelines/brand). You'll be more efficient for the following steps.
1. Make a pull-request on [our website repo](https://github.com/lewagon/www-sinatra) to add your city page (ex: [Paris page](http://www.lewagon.org/paris))
1. At this point, we'll be able to plug our *application tool* to your city page, so that you can start handling candidates right on!
1. Join us on [Le Wagon's Slack](https://teamwagon.slack.com) and create a channel for your city `#city`.
1. Create a meetup group following our [graphical guidelines](https://github.com/lewagon/design/tree/master/guidelines/meetup) (ex: [Le Wagon Paris meetup](http://www.meetup.com/fr/Le-Wagon-Paris-Coding-Station/))
1. Create a city Twitter account `@lewagon<city_name>` (e.g. `@lewagonlosangeles`)
1. For Facebook / Youtube, we all play as a team and use the same page.

## Bootstrapping

- When the setup is done, time to work on the *acquisition*.
- Connect to tech spots (cool coworking places, startup accelerators...) that accept to give your their place to organize free workshops in the evening, and communicate on theses events with their community. Of course, use your meetup group to plan these workshops!
- Make at least **1 workshop / week**. Creating a physical community and showing people your pedagogical skills is the best way to onboard candidates.
- Connect to ruby and dev communities to meet potential teachers if you haven't any developers in the team yet. We'll be more than happy to help you test potential teachers in skype sessions.
- Making cool workshops in tech spots is also a way to find a place to run the 1st batches of the fullstack program. Discuss it with them from the beginning.

Now a bit of resources and help for organizing the workshops
