## Set up

- Join us on [Le Wagon's Slack](https://teamwagon.slack.com) and create a channel for your city `#city`.
- Read [our graphical guidelines](https://github.com/lewagon/design/tree/master/guidelines) and download our [brand assets](https://github.com/lewagon/design/tree/master/guidelines/brand) to save time in the next steps.
- Make a pull-request on [Le Wagon website repository](https://github.com/lewagon/www-sinatra) to add your city page (ex: [Paris page](http://www.lewagon.org/paris))
- When it's done, we'll plug our *application tool* to your city page, and you can start getting candidates right on!
- Create a meetup group following our [meetup graphical guidelines](https://github.com/lewagon/design/tree/master/guidelines/meetup) (ex: [Le Wagon Paris meetup](http://www.meetup.com/fr/Le-Wagon-Paris-Coding-Station/))
- Create a Twitter account for your city `@lewagon<city_name>` (e.g. `@lewagonlosangeles`)
- For Facebook / Youtube, we all play as a team and use the same page/channel.

## Bootstrapping

- When the setup is done, time to work on the **acquisition**.
- Connect to tech spots (coworking places, startup accelerators...) that accept to organize Le Wagon's free workshops in their place and help you communicate on them. Of course, use your meetup group for these workshops!
- Make at least **1 workshop / week**. Showing your pedagogical skills is the best way to onboard candidates.
- Connect to ruby and devs communities to meet potential teachers if you don't have any developers in the team yet. We'll be more than happy to help you test potential teachers during skype sessions.
- From the beginning, discuss with these tech spots about the opportunity to run the first batches of the program in their place.

Now a bit of help for running workshops and pitching Le Wagon's program.

## 1s batch is live !

You have your 20 students for the 1st batch. **Yeahhhhhh!** time for us to add your lead developpers on our pedagogical platforms and explain them all about it.

## Dont's

Launching Le Wagon is a matter of **trust** and **shared values**. We should all play as a unique team which will improve the quality of the work in each team.

By collaborating to improve pedagogical contents, graphical assets, communication supports, etc.. we can just create something much bigger.

Of course, you are the business owner, you drive your city, your community, your opportunities, and can experiment things, but collaborating with each other is a core value to be part of Le Wagon.

Here is a list of actions that don't really fit with this value :

- Double-brandings with expressions such as **Le Wagon by ...** or **... by Le Wagon**: if you launch Le Wagon, it's Le Wagon and adding an extra brand is just weakening your communication and blurring the message.
- Create an **independent landing page**: instead, you should make a pull request to our website city page so that every one can benefit from it. That's our spirit !
