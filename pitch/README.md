## Pain

Many talented people are frustrated because:

- They have business ideas and want to **build their startup**
- They dream of a more **interested & creative career** finding a job in the tech industry (developer, product manager, growth hacker..)
- They want to **re-invent their current work** using new tools, new technologies, new workflow.

They don't have the technical skills for that... **for the moment**

## Mission (why)

**Le Wagon brings technical skills to these creative people**. That's our big mission.

## Fullstack Program (how)

For that, we've built a very **intensive & selective 9-week program** to teach software engineering and web-development to 24 skilled students.

- We start with coding basics, go through software/DB architecture & frontend development to finish on modern web frameworks (Rails).
- All the way down, we explain best practices used in startups (collaboration techniques on Github, hosting & continuous deployment, etc...)
- Above all, we change students' mindset and feed their creativity with technical insights.


## Platforms & community (what)

Le Wagon is not a traditional coding school. **We've built and iterate custom tools & platforms during 2 years** with more than 300 challenges and 45 lectures, **getting rid of every friction in the learning process**. Every day, students are pair programming and pushing their solution using git & Github to be automatically corrected, from day one.

Above the platforms & tools, **applying to Le Wagon means enrolling in an fantastic community**. At the end of the 2 months you'll speak the same language as your 300+ peers. You can help each other, share tips on Le Wagon's chat, get answers to your questions and keep learning and making progress.

Le Wagon's community is simply **the best tech community** you can imagine. You can ask any student!
